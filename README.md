### About it :bookmark_tabs:

This project is the usage of [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) in a custom dataset of cars with instance segmentation. It was used an online annotation tool called [Make Sense](https://www.makesense.ai/) for the annotation process of each image in a COCO format.

For a future work it is recommended to use a custom dataset with another feature like Keypoint Detection. Futhermore it is worth to tune the parameters for better results.

### Usage üìù

It is recommended to use the .ipynb file (inside /src)  with colab. You will need to make changes to load train and test datasets and to save them into detectron2.
